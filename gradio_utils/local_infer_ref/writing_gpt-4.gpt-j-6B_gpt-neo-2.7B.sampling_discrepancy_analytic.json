She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo.

She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. She tried the knob on the right, and it gave her cold water. But the third knob, placed mysteriously in the middle, intrigued her. What could be its function? With a curious twist, she turned it. At first, nothing. Then, to her surprise, a slow trickle of sparkling water started flowing. The water was different, with a luminous glow unlike any she'd seen before. As she touched it, a wave of calm washed over her. It was as if this enchanted water had healing powers. Day by day, she found herself drawn to this mystical faucet, slowly realizing she was the keeper of a magical water source. The third knob wasn't just an ordinary knob, it was a gateway to tranquility and peace. This running faucet had become her secret sanctuary, a testament to the magic lurking in the most ordinary corners of life.", "sampled_crit": 1.4809366464614868}], "metrics": {"roc_auc":
